# LensExif
A little application with GUI to add or modify lens and aperture exif data to raw files (.nef, .arw, .dng, etc.), useful for people people using manual lenses on digital cameras.

You can prewiew images:

# Install

It works on Linux, should work on windows and Mac OS X, but never tried.

First install: libimage-exiftool-perl pyside2-tools pyside2-tools python3-pyside2.qtwidgets

From python3-pip: rawpy imgio

For now you just download the code and execute 

> python (path-to-folder)/src/lens_exif_view.py

Later I will add an install file.
